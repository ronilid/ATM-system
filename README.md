# üè¶ ATM System API

A simple ATM simulation API built with FastAPI.  
The system supports depositing, withdrawing, and checking balances for in-memory accounts, with proper validation and error handling.  

---
## Features
- Create new accounts
- Deposit & withdraw money
- Check account balance
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Health check endpoint

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Deployment**: Render (Free plan)
- **Testing**: Postman

## Installation:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-system.git
   cd atm-system
    ````

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Server:

Run with:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Default server URL:
 [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

Swagger documentation:

## Deployment (Render)

This API is deployed on Render (Free plan).

- Live API: `https://atm-system-v85j.onrender.com`
- Health: `https://atm-system-v85j.onrender.com/health`
- Docs (Swagger): `https://atm-system-v85j.onrender.com/docs`

Note about Free plan: the service may go idle when unused.  
The first request after idle can take a few seconds (cold start). Subsequent requests are fast.


 ## API Endpoints

### Health Check
| Method | Endpoint  | Description                 | Success | Errors |
|-------:|-----------|-----------------------------|---------|--------|
| GET    | `/health` | Verify the service is alive | `{ "message": "ok" }` | ‚Äì |

---

### Get Balance
| Method | Endpoint                             | Description                     | Success | Errors |
|-------:|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------|--------|
| GET    | `/accounts/{account_number}/balance` | Return current account balance  | `{ "account_number": "1001", "balance": 250.0 }` | `400` invalid account format<br>`404` not found |

---

|-------:|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|------|---------|--------|
| POST   | `/accounts/{account_number}/deposit` | Deposit money to acct | `{ "amount": 50 }` | `{ "message": "Deposit successful", "balance": 300.0 }` | `400` invalid body / non-positive amount<br>`404` not found |

---

### Withdraw
| Method | Endpoint                              | Description                | Body | Success | Errors |

### cURL Examples
```bash
# Health
curl -s https://atm-system-v85j.onrender.com/health

# Get balance
curl -s https://atm-system-v85j.onrender.com/accounts/1001/balance

# Deposit 50
curl -s -X POST https://atm-system-v85j.onrender.com/accounts/1001/deposit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"amount": 50}'

# Withdraw 100
curl -s -X POST https://atm-system-v85j.onrender.com/accounts/1001/withdraw \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"amount": 100}'


## Testing with Postman

A Postman collection (`atm_system.postman_collection.json`) is included.

How to use:

1. Open **Postman** ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Select the JSON file.
2. Ensure the base URL is set to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
3. Run the predefined requests (balance, deposit, withdraw, and error cases).

## Design Choices:

* **Decimal for money**: Python `Decimal` ensures precise financial calculations, avoiding floating-point errors.
* **Quantization**: All balances are normalized to 2 decimal places with `ROUND_HALF_UP` (typical financial rounding).
* **Thread safety**: Deposits and withdrawals use a global `Lock` to avoid race conditions. Reads (`GET balance`) are lock-free for performance.
* **Manual validation**: Instead of only relying on FastAPI‚Äôs built-in validation, custom checks were added for friendlier, clearer error messages.
* **Status codes**:
  * 400 for invalid requests (bad body, invalid amount, insufficient funds).
  * 404 for account not found.

## Challenges & Decisions:

- Choosing the stack: I debated whether to use Node.js or Python. Finally picked FastAPI because it‚Äôs quick to set up, has async support, and generates nice docs automatically.
- Money precision: At first I used floats, but quickly realized it might cause rounding errors. I switched to Decimal to keep things accurate.
- Error handling: Tried FastAPI‚Äôs auto-validation only, but the errors felt too raw. I added manual checks so the API feels clearer and more user-friendly.
- Thread safety: I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to lock balance checks too. Decided not to, since they don‚Äôt change the state and slight staleness is acceptable.
- Hosting: Considered AWS/Heroku, but for a small project and no budget I‚Äôd choose Render as an easy free option.
- I faced a few small challenges: connecting GitHub and working around the free plan limitations (manual deploys, cold starts).  
  Eventually I managed to configure it successfully, and the live link is stable and accessible.

## Example Errors:

Invalid account number:

```json
{ "detail": "Invalid account number format" }
```

Account not found:

```json
{ "detail": "Account not found" }
```

Invalid body:

```json
{ "detail": "Missing 'amount' field" }
```

Insufficient funds:

```json
{ "detail": "Insufficient funds" }
```

## Future Improvements

* Persistent storage (DB instead of in-memory).
* User accounts & authentication (e.g.,login,JWT).
* Account creation endpoint.
* PUT/DELETE endpoints for updating account metadata
* Improved transaction history tracking.
